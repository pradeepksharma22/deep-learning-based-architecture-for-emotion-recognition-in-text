# Deep Learning Based Aarchitecture for Emotion Recognition in Text - LJMU Dissertation for Masters in Machine Learning and AI


### Problem Statement
Emotions are an essential part of communication, and they can convey a lot of information in a short amount of time. For example, a simple question can have multiple answers, but the correct answer can be determined by understanding the emotional context behind the question. This underscores the importance of emotion detection within the realm of natural language processing (NLP) when working with textual data.

In this research paper, we are going to propose a new approach to emotion detection which is a extension of RoBERTa. This approach combines a pre-trained RoBERTa model with a GoEmotions dataset, which contains 27 different emotions and a neutral emotion. 

The proposed approach would be a significant contribution to the field of emotion detection. The aim is to create a more robust and accurate model than previous approaches, and it can be used in a variety of NLP tasks.
